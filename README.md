# 🐈‍⬛ kittygpt

A friendly, minimalist, fully-featured ChatGPT completion + voice chat library.

- Tiny, isomorphic, no dependencies (except when running on NodeJS).
- Streaming, structured outputs, function calling, retries, system message handling.
- No classes. No setup. Just clean calls and smooth purrs.

Built because the official SDK fell short.

Published under GPL because software should be free.

Don't let the short README fool you. All the juicy details can be found in the wiki:

- [Completion API](https://github.com/camilaprav/kittygpt/wiki/Completion-API): A complete guide into the completion API part of the library. Documents configuration, basic usage, streaming, function calls, and exposed internal helpers.
- [Voice Chat API](https://github.com/camilaprav/kittygpt/wiki/Voice-Chat-API): The same, but for voice chat. Documents both browser and NodeJS usage, as well as function calling.
- [Autoassist API](https://github.com/camilaprav/kittygpt/wiki/Autoassist-API): The same, but for the autoassist API. Use this API to turn any SPA into a fully voice-interactive app with a single function call!

## 🐾 Philosophy

> The official SDK is bloated, brittle, and too complicated.
> `kittygpt` is clean, modular, hackable, and sharp.
> It works the way you *wish* OpenAI’s SDK did.
> And it doesn’t meow around.
